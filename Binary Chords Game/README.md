# Binary Chords - The Game

A basic Guitar-Hero-like game for practicing using my [Binary Chords](https://github.com/obsoletenerd/binary-chords) keyboard.

Uses your normal keyboard to practice, with "ASDF" and "HJKL" simulating having your hands on the Binary Chords keyboard.

Download the folder then type `uv run game.py` to start the game. ESC to quit.
